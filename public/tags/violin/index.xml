      <description>Trumpet DVD Testimonials It’s been a year since we released the Haydn and Hummel Trumpet Concerto DVDs from the legendary Rolf Smedvig, and look at some of the great feedback we’ve been receiving:
&amp;quot;These are excellent pedagogical videos... they are Rolf&#39;s parting legacy for young trumpeters and their teachers.&amp;quot; -- Barry Kilpatrick, Reviewer, American Record Guide (January/February 2016 edition)  &amp;quot;Smedvig’s pedagogical advice is excellent… The value of this resource is immense for musicians of all levels.</description>

      <description>Four years ago we set out on a mission based on a simple idea - to bring high quality music education into the homes of students all around the world. We recognize that music education budgets are being cut all over the world; the majority of instrumental students may not have access to private instruction, and therefore never master the most essential repertoire for their instruments. It is our goal to provide to all music students access to lessons taught by world-renowned performers of the absolute highest caliber.</description>
