text: "Lara St. John's 'Learning from the Legends' series provides an extremely thorough and thoughtful walk-through of core repertoire, as well as the amazing experience of seeing how a top professional makes her way around the musical and technical challenges of these masterpieces. Lara's methods of breaking down the technical difficulties and her practical and well-explained practice techniques are wonderful. One of these DVDs is like weeks and weeks of private lessons! The programs are beautifully filmed and presented, and would be of great value to any aspiring violinist."
