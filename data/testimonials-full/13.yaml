text: "Lara St. John is an exceptional violinist with a tremendous sound, sense of style, authenticity and a natural fit with the instrument. I was particularly taken by her ability to reveal the most detailed, intricate solutions to the most challenging passages in both of the timeless works, given her own seemingly effortless illustration of the material. Lara is a rare and excellent example of a true artist and a pedagogue. I have no doubt that the series would benefit and provide invaluable lessons to countless young violinists worldwide."
