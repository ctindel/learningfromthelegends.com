text: "In these DVDs, Lara St John is a wonderful tour guide through the musical and violinistic landscapes of the Bruch and Mendelssohn violin concerti. With the same open warmth and enthusiasm that she brings to her performances, she offers a wide range of information and insights that will appeal to and inspire students at several different stages. Perhaps her most valuable message, present as an undercurrent throughout the videos, is that passionate involvement with the music goes hand-in-hand with detailed and methodically planned technical work and musical thought."
