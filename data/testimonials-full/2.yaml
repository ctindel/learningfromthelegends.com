text: "Smedvig’s pedagogical advice is excellent… The value of this resource is immense for musicians of all levels. Gaining a window into both the musical interpretation and approach to the trumpet by a musician of Smedvig’s caliber is fascinating… This disc would be a fine addition to the collectionsof students and performers of all ability levels."
