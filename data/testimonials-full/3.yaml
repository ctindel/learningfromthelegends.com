text: "This program of Learning From the Legends will absolutely occupy a much-needed, methodical, and all-encompassing reference for trumpeters of all ages. I highly recommend this thoughtful legacy project that seeks to make sense of making music on the trumpet by using great music as its source. This is a great project!"
