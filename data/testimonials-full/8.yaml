text: "Lara St. John is a brilliant maverick violinist with constantly unique and fresh perspectives and an uncanny ability to get around the instrument in the most organic way. With this collection she generously reveals the mechanics of two of the most popular violin concertos: Bruch and Mendelssohn.

These incredibly comprehensive guides examine each concerto in great detail and are an invaluable tool to any violinist attempting to play these pieces.

The lessons are presented in Lara's usual charming and witty manner, making the works accessible and clear for any age group. They provide an opportunity for violin players to quickly grasp the technical and interpretive demands needed.

I highly recommend these 'must have' DVDs to anyone who wants to speed up a thorough learning process of these masterworks."
