text: "As a conductor and educator, I have been extremely fortunate to have learned from such legends as Rafael Mendez, William Bell, Elizabeth Green, William D. Revelli and others. The young musicians who have not yet encountered a 'Legend' and even those who have, will greatly benefit from these instructional videos featuring some of the world’s greatest classical music performers as presented by 'Learning from the Legends'.

These instructional videos are professionally recorded and they are at the highest level. As a private teacher, I would find them invaluable. As a conductor, they reinforce much of what is worked on and hopefully accomplished in any rehearsal. In addition, the recordings provide a play-along track, which is extremely helpful. The instructor (Legend) performs the selected work, a few measures at a time, and then provides a annotated copy of the soloist’s score, which, along with well thought-out explanatory monologue, gives the student enormous insight into what they just heard and saw.

Having attended several workshops by the Empire Brass, I was thrilled to see the video of trumpeter Rolf Smedvig. He was the founder of the Empire Brass and will long be remembered as one of the finest trumpet players in the world. His instruction on breathing in this video is not to be missed by any wind player.

Canadian born Laura St. John has performed as a soloist all over the world. Her recent album Shiksa has received high reviews including this quote by composer John Corigliano, 'I love it!! So much beautiful music played so passionately. I am completely blown away by this album.' Her performances and instructions on the Mendelssohn and the Bruch on the “Learning from the Legends” are priceless.

I look forward to many more wonderful videos, both as DVDs and on the Internet."
