text: "Rolf Smedvig's Learning from the Legends Trumpet DVDs for Haydn and Hummel are exceedingly educational."
longtext: "Learning from the Legends is a wonderful idea. The DVD's you have produced of Rolf Smedvig sharing his ideas for performing the Haydn and Hummel will be exceedingly educational to anyone wishing to learn these classic pieces. It is very important to communicate the importance of producing a beautiful sound, and Rolf is known for his wonderful sound. I especially appreciated his simple way of approaching and improving your breathing. This is a 'winner'. Keep up the good work."
