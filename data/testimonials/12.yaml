longtext: "Lara St. John does a marvelous job providing insight into the beloved masterworks of the violin repertoire. The series of lessons dissect the concerti measure by measure, examining key technical aspects and interpretive ideas. Particularly effective is Lara's approach: elegant, unassuming, yet powerfully convincing. The series is a true instructional gem for violinist of all walks of life!"
