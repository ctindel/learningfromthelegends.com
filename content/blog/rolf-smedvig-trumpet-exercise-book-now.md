It's been a couple of years since we released the [Rolf Smedvig Haydn and Hummel Trumpet Concerto DVDs](/instruments/trumpet).  One of the things that was mentioned in the DVDs is that some bonus technical exercises were included with the product.  Many of you have written in to ask about these as you couldn't find them under the DVD bonus features section.

Before Rolf's tragic passing he had given us a stack of hand-written exercises and notes for us to publish an exercise booklet as a companion to the DVDs, along with the beautiful editions of the concertos that are already available for free download on our website.  It took us a little while to compile and edit this booklet, but we are happy to announce that it is now available for download.

If you head to the [Haydn](/instruments/trumpet/haydn) or [Hummel](instruments/trumpet/hummel) DVD product pages you will now find a link to download the Technical Exercises Booklet as a PDF.  We hope you enjoy it (as much as one enjoys technical exercises anyway!) and find it useful during your musical journey, and as an organization we are very happy to have been involved in Rolf's continuing educational legacy.

Musically yours,

Chad Tindel
