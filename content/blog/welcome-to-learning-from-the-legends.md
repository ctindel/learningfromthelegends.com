Four years ago we set out on a mission based on a simple idea - to bring high quality music education into the homes of students all around the world. We recognize that music education budgets are being cut all over the world; the majority of instrumental students may not have access to private instruction, and therefore never master the most essential repertoire for their instruments. It is our goal to provide to all music students access to lessons taught by world-renowned performers of the absolute highest caliber.

Today we take the first step towards reaching that goal. We have made generally available for online purchase two DVDs taught by the phenomenal violinist Lara St. John: Bruch's Violin Concerto No. 1 in G Minor, Op. 26 and Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto in E Minor, Op. 64. These works are part of the core violin repertoire that all violinists must learn, and are often used as audition selections for universities and conservatories, as well as prestigious honor orchestras.
Our products provide you with everything you need to supplement private instruction in order to improve your performance and understanding of these works. In addition to measure-by-measure instruction, we also provide you with:

* A full performance of each concerto allowing the viewer to see and hear the works performed with piano accompaniment in an audition context
* Piano Accompaniment Practice Tracks - to hone their performance skills playing along with a piano practice track provided exclusively by Learning from the Legends
* Special edition downloadable sheet music, edited by Lara St. John and Joey Corpus
* Extensive demonstrations of technical exercises which students can use to fine-tune the skills needed for this concerto

We will quickly follow these releases with two DVDs for trumpet taught by former principal trumpet of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Rolf Smedvig. These productions cover arguably the two most important works in trumpet repertoire: Haydn’s Trumpet Concerto in E-flat Major and Hummel’s Trumpet Concerto. These products are nearing release, and are currently finishing up post-production. We expect them to be ready for purchase by Thanksgiving 2014.

Initial releases of everything will be on physical DVD available through a number of online and physical retailers, but should be quickly followed up with digital releases available in iTunes and Amazon Instant Video. If you aren’t able to find a purchasing outlet in your location please contact us and we’ll see what we can do!
Our long-term goal is of course to expand our line to include all the string, brass, and woodwind instruments as well as several vocal ranges. This collection will grow over time, and we look forward to working with the musical community to make this dream a reality!

Musically yours,
