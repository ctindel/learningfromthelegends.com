## Trumpet DVD Testimonials
It’s been a year since we released the Haydn and Hummel Trumpet Concerto DVDs from the legendary Rolf Smedvig, and look at some of the great feedback we’ve been receiving:

```
"These are excellent pedagogical videos... they are Rolf's parting legacy for young trumpeters and their teachers."
-- Barry Kilpatrick, Reviewer, American Record Guide (January/February 2016 edition)
```

```
"Smedvig’s pedagogical advice is excellent… The value of this resource is immense for musicians of all levels.  Gaining a window into both the musical interpretation and approach to the trumpet by a musician of Smedvig’s caliber is fascinating… This disc would be a fine addition to the collections of students and performers of all ability levels."
-- Dr. Jason Crafton
Reviewer, International Trumpet Guild Journal (October 2016)
Assistant Professor of Trumpet, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA

## New HD Streaming options
Learning from the Legends is proud to announce today a giant leap
into the future: We now have High Definition online streaming options
for all of our music lessons.  They are available in the Amazon Video
Store for musicians in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom,
Australia, and New Zealand.  Here are some links to get you started:

* [Mendelssohn Violin Concerto with Lara St. John](http://a.co/9dgbM8s)
* [Bruch Violin Concerto with Lara St. John](http://a.co/5XC6e5e)
* [Haydn Trumpet Concerto with Rolf Smedvig](http://a.co/1vEq1yU)
* [Hummel Trumpet Concerto with Rolf Smedvig](http://a.co/1JQlnAV)

Each work is structured as a season of a TV show so you can buy only the parts ("episodes") that you need.  Some examples:

* You're a trumpet student preparing a single movement of the Haydn Trumpet Concerto for honor band auditions, now you can buy just the "episode" teaching that you movement.
* You're a high school teacher and would like to purchase only the performance of Lara St. John performing the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto with Piano Accompaniment in a recital setting to show your students in class, now you can buy just the Recital Performance "Episode"
* You want all the material, including the bonus features found on the full DVD, you can purchase the entire "Season" and get the full bundle.

We're excited to have all these great options available and we hope you
enjoy them as well.  We have received a lot of great testimonials from
students, parents, and educators and we'd always like to hear more!  Please
email [feedback@learningfromthelegends.com](mailto:feedback@learningfromthelegends.com) or contact us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/LFTLegends) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LFTLegends)
if you have feedback for us.

We expect to continue growing our lesson offerings, but we need your help to do it!
You can assist us in getting the word out to everyone you know. We are currently
developing production plans to produce two Flute lessons featuring another
world-renowned artist.  We would very much like to get into the studio
as soon as possible to start creating, but we can’t do it without the continued
success of our violin and trumpet lessons.  Please help us make this dream a reality!

Musically yours,

Chad Tindel
